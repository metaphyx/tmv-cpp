Note: More complete installation information is contained in 
doc/TMV_Documentation.pdf.  If the instructions there differ from these, 
then it is probably true that the pdf is correct, rather than this file.


First, see INSTALL for instructions on downloading and unpacking the 
tarball if you have not already done so.

This file give the instructions for installing TMV using the program make.


1. Edit Makefile:

   There are 5 things at the start of the makefile that will 
   possibly need to be changed.  The defaults are:

   CC= g++
   INCLUDE= -Iinclude
   CFLAGS= $(INCLUDE) -O -DNOBLAS -DNDEBUG
   BLASLIBS= 
   PREFIX=/usr/local

   CC should be set to whatever C++ compiler you want to use.
   The code has been tested with:
       g++ versions 3.4.6, 4.0.2, 4.1.2, 4.2.2, 4.3.1, and 4.3.2
       icc versions 9.0, 9.1, 10.1, and 11.0
       pgCC version 6.1
       Microsoft Visual C++ Express 2008 Edition
   It should work with any ansi-compliant compiler, these 
   are all that I have access to at the moment, and therefore, all that
   I have been able to test.

   For CFLAGS, there are a number of -D defines that you may want to use in 
   addition to any optimization parameters like -fast, -O, etc.
   A comprehensive list is provided in the pdf documentation.

   In particular, there are flags to control which types to instantiate 
   for the compiled functions.  The default is to instantiate functions
   for double and float (and their corresponding complex varieties).

     -DNO_INST_FLOAT -- Don't instantiate float or complex<float>
     -DNO_INST_DOUBLE -- Don't instantiate double or complex<double>
     -DNO_INST_COMPLEX -- Don't instantiate any complex types
     -DINST_INT -- Instantiate int and complex<int>
     -DINST_LONGDOUBLE -- Instantiate long double and complex<long double>

   Also, there are some flags to specify some popular BLAS/LAPACK options:

     -DCBLAS -- Use a CBlas Library
     -DFBLAS -- Use a Fortran Blas Library
     -DATLAS -- Use the ATLAS Blas Library
     -DMKL -- Use Intel's Math Kernel Library for BLAS/LAPACK
     -DACML -- Use the AMD Core Math Library for BLAS/LAPACK
     -DCLAPACK -- Use the CLAPACK Library
     -DFLAPACK -- Use a Fortran LAPACK Library
     -DNOBLAS -- Do not use any external BLAS library
     -DNOLAP -- Do not use any external LAPACK library

   INCLUDE should include the locations of any BLAS or LAPACK .h files
   that you are using.  e.g.:
   
     INCLUDE= -Iinclude -I/usr/local/atlas/include

   BLASLIBS should include the linking options for any BLAS or LAPACK
   libraries that you need to link to.  e.g.:
   
     BLASLIBS= -L/usr/local/atlas/lib -lcblas -latlas

   There are examples in the Makefile itself for a variety of systems
   which can help you determine what is appropriate for your machine.
   Also, see doc/TMV_Documentation.pdf for more details and 
   known issues for some compilers.

   Finally, PREFIX gives the location where you want to install the 
   TMV library and include files when you type make install.


2. (advanced) Edit include/TMV_Inst.h and include/TMV_Blas.h files:

   As mentioned above, the default setup is to instantiate everything
   for floats and doubles.  In addition, int and long double may be 
   specified with the above flags.  But if you wan to instantiate 
   the TMV code for some other type, such as a user-defined type,
   then you will need to add that type to the file TMV_Inst.h.
   See that file for how to do this.

   Also, every BLAS and LAPACK package seems to use slightly different
   syntaxes.  Especially for their complex operations.  The above
   flags set things up for some popular packages, but if you have a 
   different one than these, you may need to edit TMV_Blas.h to
   set things up appropriately for your package.  See that file
   for how to do this.


3. Make the libraries:

   make libs

   This will make the files lib/libtmv.a and lib/libtmv_symband.a.


4. (optional) Make the test and example programs:

   make test

   will make the programs bin/tmvtest1, bin/tmvtest2, and bin/tmvtest3.

   They should each compile successfully, and when you run them, they 
   should output a bunch of lines reading:
     [Something] passed all tests.
 
   make examples

   will make the programs bin/vector, bin/matrix, bin/bandmatrix, 
   bin/symmatrix and bin/division.

   The code for these programs and the corresponding output should give
   you a quick guide to using the TMV library.


5. (optional) Install the library and header files:

   make install

   will copy all the header files necessary for compiling your own program
   into the directory $(PREFIX)/include and copy the library files
   into the directory $(PREFIX)/lib.  

   The default value of PREFIX is /usr/local, but this can be changed
   as described above.  


6. Compile your own program:

   Each .cpp file that uses the TMV library will need to have

   #include "TMV.h"

   at the top.  Furthermore, if you are using some of the special matrix
   varieties, you will need to include their .h files as well:

   #include "TMV_Band.h"
   #include "TMV_Sym.h"
   #include "TMV_SymBand.h"

   Also, you will need to compile with -I[tmvdir]/include,
   and also link with 

   -L[tmvdir]/lib -ltmv -lm.

   where [tmvdir] is either the directory where you installed the libraries
   or this directory if you did not.  Of course, if you installed the 
   libraries to a directory in your path, then you do not need the 
   -I and -L flags.

   If you use and banded or symmetric/hermitian matrices, then you will
   need to link with 

   -L[tmvdir]/lib -ltmv_symband -ltmv -lm

   And remember to link with whatever BLAS and/or LAPACK libraries
   that you specified for TMV to use.
