Changes from version 0.64 to 0.65:  
(See the History section in the full documentation for changes from previous
versions to 0.64.)

Bug fixes:

-- Fixed some compiling errors when using INST_INT=true.

-- In SConstruct file, now always use -fno-strict-aliasing for g++.  (It was
   just for version <= 4.2.)  I found a bug in g++ 4.5 that was fixed by
   turning off strict aliasing.  Since I don't think the strict aliasing
   optimizations are probably worth much for TMV, I decided to just always
   use the -fno-strict-aliasing flag and be safe.

New features:

-- Skip compilation of functions for <int> that it will never use.
   Also specialized some methods for <int> and complex<int> to make sure
   they don't call those routines.  If compiled with DEBUG=true, the
   compiled code hits a TMVAssert(false).  
   
   Perhaps I should change this to throw an exception rather than use 
   Assert, so it doesn't get turned off by the (default) DEBUG=false.
   Something like InvalidCallError or something like that.
   I'd have to add that to the tmv::Error heirarchy.
   But in 0.70 these will all become static_assert failures, which is a
   better way to do it, so it's probably not worth it.

-- Updated the test suite to work better with <int> tests.  Many tests
   had been disabled for int, since the way I tested things didn't really
   work with integer matrices. But with the new changes, I can run a larger
   fraction of the test suite on <int> and <complex<int> > matrices.
   
-- Added code to correctly calculate determinants of <int> and <complex<int> >
   matrices.  And added a section in the test suite to test them.

-- Added m.sumAbs2Elements()

-- Added m.addToAll(x)

-- Added m.resize(nrows,ncols) and v.resize(n) (and similar for other Matrix
   types).

-- Added TEST_FLOAT, TEST_DOUBLE, etc. to scons options.  This allows
   for only testing one type at a time without recompiling the libraries.

-- Added ability to make the libraries shared libraries, rather than static
   with the SHARED=true scons option.
