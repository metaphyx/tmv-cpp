Note: More complete installation information is contained in 
doc/TMV_Documentation.pdf.  If the instructions there differ from these, 
then it is probably true that the pdf is correct, rather than this file.


First, see INSTALL for instructions on downloading and unpacking the 
tarball if you have not already done so.

This file give the instructions for installing TMV using the program CMake.

1. Download CMake from http://www.cmake.org/ if you do not already have it.


2. In TMV directory, type one of the following commands:

     cmake -i .    (For interactive text-based configuration)
     ccmake .      (For menu-based configuration)
     cmake .       (To use the default configuration)

   for Unix, or run CMakeSetup.exe in Windows.

   Answer the configuration questions and/or set the options listed.


3. Type:

     make 
    
   to make the libraries.

   Then type:

     make install

   to copy the libraries into /usr/local/lib and all the header files into
   /usr/local/include (or the lib and include subdirectories of wherever 
   you set as your install directory when configuring).


4. (Optional) Type:

     make test

   to make the test suite executables:

     test/tmvtest1
     test/tmvtest2
     test/tmvtest3

   If you want to make the smaller test executables instead, you can type:
   
     make smalltest

   to make the executables:

     test/tmvtest1a
     test/tmvtest1b
     test/tmvtest1c
     test/tmvtest1d
     test/tmvtest2a
     test/tmvtest2b
     test/tmvtest2c
     test/tmvtest3a
     test/tmvtest3b
     test/tmvtest3c
     test/tmvtest3d
     test/tmvtest3e

   They should each compile successfully, and when you run them, they
   should output a bunch of lines that end with "...passed all tests" 
   (or similar).  If not,
   see the documantation (doc/TMV_Documentation.pdf) for how to submit
   a bug report.

5. (Optional) Type:

     make examples

   to make the executables:

     examples/vector
     examples/matrix
     examples/division
     examples/bandmatrix
     examples/symmatrix

   These programs are a good starting point for learning how to use the 
   TMV classes.  They are not intended to be complete descriptions of 
   what the classes can do, but are rather a selection of common things that
   you might want to do.  For full documention, see doc/TMV_Documentation.pdf.


6. Compile your own program:

   Each .cpp file that uses the TMV library will need to have

   #include "TMV.h"

   at the top.  Furthermore, if you are using some of the special matrix
   varieties, you will need to include their .h files as well:

   #include "TMV_Band.h"
   #include "TMV_Sym.h"
   #include "TMV_SymBand.h"

   Also, you will need to compile with -I[tmvdir]/include,
   and also link with

   -L[tmvdir]/lib -ltmv

   where [tmvdir] is the directory where you installed the libraries
   (/usr/local by default).
   Of course, if you installed the libraries and header files to a directory 
   in your path, then you do not need the -I and -L flags.

   If you use and banded or symmetric/hermitian matrices, then you will
   need to link with the flags -ltmv_symband -ltmv.
