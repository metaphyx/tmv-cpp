Note: More complete installation information is contained in 
doc/TMV_Documentation.pdf,

First, obtain the tarball from http://sourceforge.net/projects/tmv-cpp/.

Unpack the tarball with:

gunzip tmv0.62.tar.gz
tar xf tmv0.62.tar

This will make a directory called tmv0.62 with subdirectories:
  doc
  examples
  include
  lib
  src
  test
and also the files:
  INSTALL  (This file)
  INSTALL_MAKE
  INSTALL_SCONS
  INSTALL_CMAKE
  README
  LICENSE
  CHANGELOG
  (plus others)

Now you have three options for doing the rest of the installation.

1) The standard way is to use the command make.  This is the easiest 
   installation method if you don't care about having a very optimized
   TMV library that calls LAPACK and BLAS libraries.  Also, if you want
   to do anything unusual during the installation, then this is probably
   your best bet.

   For instructions about how to do this, read the file INSTALL_MAKE.

2) The second way is to use the program SCons.  This is probably 
   the easiest way to get an optimized TMV library that calls BLAS
   and/or LAPACK.  However, it does require that you have SCons installed
   on your system.  The installation of SCons is very quick if you have 
   python installed.

   For instructions about how to do this, read the file INSTALL_SCONS.

3) The third way is to use the program CMake.  A lot of people like CMake,
   and it can do a lot of the things that SCons can do.  But I haven't used
   it much, so I'm afraid the CMake files included here don't look for 
   BLAS and LAPACK libraries or anything like that, so you still have
   to specify them by hand.  But if you are familiar with CMake, 
   this might be easier for you than the above options.

   For instructions about how to do this, read the file INSTALL_CMAKE.


Once the library is installed using one of the above methods, you
can use TMV in your own programs.  Here are a few things you should know:

Each .cpp file that uses the TMV library will need to have

#include "TMV.h"

at the top.  Furthermore, if you are using some of the special matrix
varieties, you will need to include their .h files as well:

#include "TMV_Small.h"
#include "TMV_Band.h"
#include "TMV_Sym.h"
#include "TMV_SymBand.h"

Also, you will need to compile with -I[tmvdir]/include,
and also link with 

-L[tmvdir]/lib -ltmv -lm.

where [tmvdir] is either the directory where you installed the libraries
or this directory if you did not.  Of course, if you installed the 
libraries to a directory in your path, then you do not need the 
-I and -L flags.

If you use and banded or symmetric/hermitian matrices, then you will
need to link with 

-L[tmvdir]/lib -ltmv_symband -ltmv -lm

And remember to link with whatever BLAS and/or LAPACK libraries
that you specified for TMV to use.
