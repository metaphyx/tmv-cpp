Changes from version 0.63 to 0.64:  
(See the History section in the full documentation for changes from previous
versions to 0.63.)

Bug fixes:

-- Fixed a bug in the singular value decomposition routines that sometimes
   led to infinite loops from NaN's.  Basically, if two values both 
   underflowed to 0, then it was possible for the code to calculate 
   0/0, which then led to the calculation never converging.
   Now I both restructured the calculation to make underflow less common, 
   and also explicitly check for 0's before I do the division.

-- Fixed a similar bug in the symmetric eigenvalue calculation.

-- Added a check in the test suite to run SVD with the kind of 
   severely defective matrix that had led to the above bug, so this kind 
   of error can be discovered more reliably.
   
New features:

-- Added #define statements for TMV_MAJOR_VERSION, TMV_MINOR_VERSION,
   and TMV_VERSION_AT_LEAST(major,minor) to make it easier to check the
   version of TMV being used by a program.

   (There had been a function TMV_Version() which returned a string, which
   was useful for outputting the TMV version in a log file, but not so
   useful for doing a compile-time check of which version it is.)
