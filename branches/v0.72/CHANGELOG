Changes from version 0.71 to 0.72:  
(See the History section in the full documentation for changes from previous
versions to 0.71.)

This release is mostly just some bug fixes to work with newer compilers.  But
there are also some minor changes in the installation defaults along with a 
couple new features.  However, the most significant change is probably that
TMV is now licensed under the FreeBSD license, rather than GPL.

-- Changed the license from GPL to FreeBSD.  This seems to be where the open 
   source community is moving, so I think it makes sense for TMV to have a 
   more permissive license going forward.

-- Made Scons correctly detect when g++ is really clang++.  Apple has been 
   lying about its C++ compiler in recent MacOS systems (10.7-10.9).  They use 
   clang++, but they call the program g++.  This used to mess up TMV, since 
   clang++ does not support OpenMP, so it would wrongly try to use OpenMP and 
   end up with linking problems.  TMV now detects when clang++ is masquerading 
   as g++ and handles this correctly.

-- Made the code compliant with the latest version of clang++, which suddenly
   got extra picky about how friend functions are declared, giving errors
   for code that doesn't comply with an obscure line in the standard that 
   it used to be able to compile just fine.  (Issue 9)

-- Fixed some problems with the install_name in the shared libraries.  
   (Issues 3 and 7)

-- Changed the default value of INST_INT to True, so the Matrix<int> templates
   are instantiated now unless you specifically disable them.  Enough people
   had expected them to be there and asked about why they were getting 
   linking errors when they used Matrix<int>, so I decided to build them
   by default now.  They don't add much to the library size.

-- Added a default conversion from VarConjIter to VIt.  It was an oversight
   that this wasn't possible before.  (Issue 5)
