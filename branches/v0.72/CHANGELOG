Changes from version 0.71 to 0.72:  
(See the History section in the full documentation for changes from previous
versions to 0.71.)

This release is mostly just some minor bug fixes and some changes in the 
installation defaults.

-- Correctly detects when g++ is really clang++.  Apple has been lying about
   its C++ compiler in recent MacOS systems (10.7-10.9).  They use clang++,
   but they call the program g++.  This used to mess up TMV, since clang++ 
   does not support OpenMP, so it would wrongly try to use OpenMP and end up 
   with linking problems.  TMV now detects when clang++ is masquerading as
   g++ and handles this correctly.

-- Fixes some problems with the install_name in the shared libraries.  
   (Issues #3 and #7)

-- Fixed some warnings emitted by clang++.  These weren't bugs -- just some
   things that clang++ warns about that other compilers hadn't cared about.

-- Changed the default value of INST_INT to True, so the Matrix<int> templates
   are instantiated now unless you specifically disable them.  Enough people
   had expected them to be there and asked about why they were getting 
   linking errors when they used Matrix<int>, so I decided to build them
   by default now.  They don't add much to the library size.

-- Added a default conversion from VarConjIter to VIt.  It was an oversight
   that this wasn't possible before.  (Issue #5)
