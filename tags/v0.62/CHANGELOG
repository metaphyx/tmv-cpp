Changes from version 0.61 to 0.62:  
(See the History section in the full documentation for changes from previous
versions to 0.61.)

Here is a brief list of the more important changes:

- Corrected an error with m.DivIsSet();
- Corrected the documentation regarding the m.SVD() access, especially
  that S is now a DiagMatrix, rather than a Vector.
- Changed behavior of methods like m.SVD().  Now, if SV has not been
  set already, then it will set it, rather than give an error.
- Added ListInit method for initializing a vector or matrix.
- Improved SmallMatrix class.  Now it is not derived from GenMatrix (or
  even BaseMatrix), thus removing the virtual table.  This greatly speeds
  up a lot of calculations.  I also specialized some routines for 2x2 and
  3x3 matrices, like Det and Inverse.  The caveat is that some things
  that used to be possible with SmallMatrix are not now.  Most importantly,
  arithmetic results can not be automatically instantiated any more.  They
  need to be assigned to a location, either SmallMatrix or Matrix.
  I also inlined all the division routines, rather than have it call
  the regular Matrix division routines.
- Removed some ViewOf commands that are clearer with a different notation.
  d = DiagMatrixViewOf(m) --> d = DiagMatrixViewOf(m.diag())
  U = UpperTriMatrixViewOf(m) --> U = m.UpperTri()
  U = UpperTriMatrixViewOf(m,UnitDiag) --> U = m.UpperTri(UnitDiag)
  U = UpperTriMatrixViewOf(U2,UnitDiag) --> U = U2.ViewAsUnitDiag()
- Fixed problems with LAPACK functions dstegr and sstegr.
  Now TMV can detect when stegr fails and run the alternate stedc instead.
- Added scons installation option.
- Added ability to use Fortran versions of BLAS and LAPACK.
- Include CMakeLists.txt files for cmake installations.
- Include .vcproj and .vcsln files for Visual C++ installations.
