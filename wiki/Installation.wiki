#summary Instructions for downloading and installing the TMV library

= Obtaining the source code =

1. Go to Downloads tab for a link to a tarball with all of the source code (or on the right hand side of the Project Home under "Featured Downloads").

2. Copy it to the directory where you want to put the TMV library.

3. Unpack the tarball: 
{{{
gunzip tmv0.64.tar.gz
tar xf tmv\tmvversion .tar
}}}

This will make a directory called `tmv0.64` with the subdirectories:
`doc`, `examples`, `include`, `lib`, `src` and `test`
along with the files `README`, `INSTALL` and others
in the top directory.

At this point there are several different choices for how to compile the library.
The preferred method is to use SCons.  To use this method, continue onto [SCons_Installation SCons Installation].
However, we also provide instructions for using standard [Make_Installation make],
[CMake_Installation CMake], or [Microsoft_Installation Visual C++].
