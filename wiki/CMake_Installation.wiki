#summary Instructions for installing TMV using CMake

= Installing using CMake =

CMake is another automated build tool.  I am not very well versed in it, but a user of the TMV library, Andy Molloy, sent me the \texttt{CMakeLists.txt} files that he used to compile TMV, so I am distributing them for anyone else who wants to use them.  It is an easy way to build a basic TMV library, but I am not sure how hard it is to get it working with BLAS or LAPACK libraries.  (I was about to start learning more about it when a colleague, Erin Sheldon, introduced me to SCons, which I like a lot, so I haven't been motivated to go back to CMake and really flesh it out like I did with the SCons installation script.) 

I haven't incorporated most of the options that I added to the SCons installation above.
But I think all of that is possible with CMake, so if someone who is an expert in CMake wants
to do this and send me the CMake files for it, I'll include them in future releases.

The basic usage is as follows:

1. Download CMake from [http://www.cmake.org/] if you do not already have it.

2. Configure CMake for you system. For Unix (or Linux, etc.) systems, there are two options.  For interactive text-based configuration, type (in the TMV directory): 
{{{
cmake -i .
}}}
or for menu-based configuration, type:
{{{
ccmake .
}}}

In Windows, you should instead run the program:
{{{
CMakeSetup.exe
}}}

Answer the configuration questions and/or set the options listed.

3. Build the TMV library:  Type:
{{{
make tmv
make tmv\_symband
}}}

4. (Optional) Build the test suite:  Type:
{{{
make tmvtest1
make tmvtest2
make tmvtest3
}}}
