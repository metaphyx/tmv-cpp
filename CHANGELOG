Changes from version 0.62 to 0.63:  
(See the History section in the full documentation for changes from previous
versions to 0.62.)

Here is a brief list of the more important changes:

- Added stepped versions of VectorViewOf and MatrixViewOf.
- Used template metaprogramming to speed up many SmallMatrix computations.
- Changed ListInit size checks from run-time checks to Assert statements,
  so they disappear with -DNDEBUG.
- Allow SmallMatrix to be used with moderately large M,N by using 
  StackArray class to use heap for large allocations.
